A network of 29 high resolution picture transmission (HRPT) stations, along with data recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), acquired daily global land coverage from 1 April, 1992 through September 30, 1993, with the project subsequently extended through 1996. The six major participants (NOAA, ESA, USGS, NASA, CSIRO, and SMC) coordinate HRPT receiving stations to acquire and compile the data set. NOAA coordinates two HRPT receiving stations, Gilmore Creek, Alaska and Wallops Island, Virginia, and schedules the satellite's recorders to obtain local area coverage (LAC) AVHRR 1-km data over areas not covered by the other HRPT receiving stations. \r\n\r\nThis collection of over 40,000 AVHRR images has been archived and made available for distribution by the United States Geological Survey, EROS Center and the European Space Agency. \r\n ",

      "abstractText": "The Remote Sensing Phenology (RSP) collection is a set of nine annual phenological metrics for the conterminous United States. Researchers at the USGS EROS Center utilize data gathered by satellite sensors to track seasonal changes in vegetation. The satellite sensors that provide the raw data are the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellites. The satellite data are initially transformed into Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. AVHRR NDVI provide the foundation for the phenology metrics. Time-series NDVI can be summarized and analyzed to produce nine key phenological indicators that represent a complete growing season. These data represent a powerful tool for documenting plant life-cycle trends over time and detecting the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe complete set of phenological metrics are as follows: 1. Start of Season Time (SOST): starting time of the onset of the growing season (in day of the year). 2. Start of Season NDVI (SOSN): NDVI value at the starting time of the onset of the growing season (unitless- based on NDVI units). 3. End of Season Time (EOST): ending time of the growing season (in day of the year). 4. End of Season NDVI (EOSN): NDVI value at the ending time of the growing season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 5. Maximum Time (MAXT): the day of the year when the NDVI reaches its maximum during the growing season (in day of the year). 6. Maximum NDVI (MAXN): the highest (or peak) value in NDVI observed in a growing season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 7. Duration (DUR): the length of the growing season-the time between the start of season and end of season (in number of days). 8. Amplitude (AMP): the difference between the Maximum NDVI and NDVI at the day of start of season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 9. Time Integrated NDVI (TIN): the cumulative value of NDVI from the start to the end of the growing season.",

      "abstractText": "The Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets are a collection of orthorectified, cloud-minimized Landsat-type satellite images, providing near complete coverage of the global land area decadally since the early 1970s. The global mosaics are centered on 1975, 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010, and consist of data acquired from five sensors: Operational Land Imager, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, Thematic Mapper, Multispectral Scanner, and Advanced Land Imager. This newest version combines all of the GLS data into one collection which has all of the combined collections. The GLS datasets have been widely used in land-cover and land-use change studies at local, regional, and global scales. This study evaluates the GLS datasets with respect to their spatial coverage, temporal consistency, geodetic accuracy, radiometric calibration consistency, image completeness, extent of cloud contamination, and residual gaps. The datasets have been improved in order to give spatial continuity across all decadal collections. Most of the imagery (85%) having cloud cover of less than 10%, the acquisition years clustered much more tightly around their target years, better co-registration relative to GLS-2000, and better radiometric absolute calibration. Probably, the most significant impediment to scientific use of the datasets is the variability of image phenology (i.e., acquisition day of year). This collection provides end-users with an assessment of the quality of the GLS datasets for specific applications, and where possible, suggestions for mitigating their deficiencies.",

      "abstractText": "The Remote Sensing Phenology (RSP) collection is a set of nine annual phenological metrics for the conterminous United States. Researchers at the USGS EROS Center utilize data gathered by satellite sensors to track seasonal changes in vegetation. The satellite sensors that provide the raw data are the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) carried aboard National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Terra and Aqua satellites. The satellite data are initially transformed into Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. eMODIS NDVI provide the foundation for the phenology metrics. Time-series NDVI can be summarized and analyzed to produce nine key phenological indicators. These data represent a powerful tool for documenting plant life-cycle trends and detecting the impacts of climate change on ecosystems.\r\nThe complete set of phenological metrics are as follows: 1. Start of Season Time (SOST): starting time of the onset of the growing season (in day of the year). 2. Start of Season NDVI (SOSN): NDVI value at the starting time of the onset of the growing season (unitless- based on NDVI units). 3. End of Season Time (EOST): ending time of the growing season (in day of the year). 4. End of Season NDVI (EOSN): NDVI value at the ending time of the growing season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 5. Maximum Time (MAXT): the day of the year when the NDVI reaches its maximum during the growing season (in day of the year). 6. Maximum NDVI (MAXN): the highest (or peak) value in NDVI observed in a growing season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 7. Duration (DUR): the length of the growing season-the time between the start of season and end of season (in number of days). 8. Amplitude (AMP): the difference between the Maximum NDVI and NDVI at the day of start of season (unitless-based on NDVI units). 9. Time Integrated NDVI (TIN): the cumulative value of NDVI from the start to the end of the growing season (unitless-based on accumulated NDVI unit",

      "abstractText": "Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophotoquadrangle (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overage ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The overage is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from 0 to 255. The standard, uncompressed gray scale DOQ format contains an ASCII header followed by a series of 8-bit image data lines. The keyword-based, ASCII header may vary in the number of data entries. The header is affixed to the beginning of the image and is composed of strings of 80 characters with an asterisk (*) as character 79 and an invisible newline character as character 80. Each keyword string contains information for either identification, display, or registration of the image. Additional strings of blanks are added to the header so that the length of a header line equals the number of bytes in a line of image data. The header line will be equal in length to the length of an image line. If the sum of the byte count of the header is less than the sample count of one DOQ image line, then the remainder of the header is padded with the requisite number of 80 character blank entries, each terminated with an asterisk and newline character.",

      "abstractText": "The three-camera Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) that operated on Landsat satellites 1 and 2 acquired approximately 1600 sub-scenes at 80 meter resolution. The initial RBV sensor configuration used three independent cameras, each sensing a different spectral wavelength (0.48 to 0.83). Landsat 1 & 2 RBV data were recorded to 70 mm black & white film rolls at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and delivered to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center for archiving and user distribution. The RBV sensor utilized vidicon tube instruments containing an electron gun that read images from a photoconductive faceplate similar to television cameras. The data stream received from the satellite was analog-to-digital preprocessed to correct for radiometric and geometric errors. The RBV system was redesigned for Landsat 3 to use a two camera configuration mounted side by side that acquired four sub-scenes within the field of view of a Multispectral Scanner (MSS) scene. The Landsat 3 RBV spatial resolution is 40 meters. Landsat 3 data were also recorded to 70 mm film until the EROS Digital Imagery Processing System (EDIPS) became operational in 1979. EROS Laser Beam Recorders (LBR's) recorded MSS and RBV data at 28 micron to 9-inch film rolls and the imagery was chipped up for archival storage and remains a viable archive backup to the digital MSS archive. However, all of the RBV digital archive data were purged for lack of computer compatible reasons. Today, the RBV 70 mm and 9-inch film sources are maintained in the USGS EROS archive and are accessible through EarthExplorer as an on-demand film scanning product. RBV images that are scanned are used to generate browse and archive TIFF products that remain as no-cost options for all users. The RBV raw TIFF products are not georeferenced. They are black & white images that faithfully represent the Landsat RBV film archive as it exists today.\r\n",

The exposed film was developed and the images were analyzed for a range of military applications.\r\n\r\nThe KH-7 surveillance system was a high resolution imaging system that was operational from July 1963 to June 1967. Approximately 18,000 black-and-white images and 230 color images are available from the 38 missions flown during this program. Key features for this program were larger area of coverage and improved ground resolution. The cameras acquired imagery in continuous lengthwise sweeps of the terrain. KH-7 images are 9 inches wide, vary in length from 4 inches to 500 feet long, and have a resolution of 2 to 4 feet.\r\n\r\nThe KH-9 mapping program was operational from March 1973 to October 1980 and was designed to support mapping requirements and exact positioning of geographical points for the military. This was accomplished by using image overlap for stereo coverage and by using a camera system with a reseau grid to correct image distortion. The KH-9 framing cameras produced 9 x 18 inch imagery at a resolution of 20-30 feet. Approximately 29,000 mapping images were acquired from 12 missions.\r\n\r\nThe images have variable scales and quality. Cloud cover is common.

      "abstractText": "The USGS and the NGA have collaborated on the development of a notably enhanced global elevation model named the GMTED2010 that replaces GTOPO30 as the elevation dataset of choice for global and continental scale applications. The new model has been generated at three separate resolutions (horizontal post spacing) of 30 arc-seconds (about 1 kilometer), 15 arc-seconds (about 500 meters), and 7.5 arc-seconds (about 250 meters). This new product suite provides global coverage of all land areas from latitude 84 degrees N to 56 degrees S for most products, and coverage from 84 degrees N to 90 degrees S for several products. Some areas, namely Greenland and Antarctica, do not have data available at the 15- and 7.5-arc-second resolutions because the input source data do not support that level of detail. An additional advantage of the new multi-resolution global model over GTOPO30 is that seven new raster elevation products are available at each resolution. The new elevation products have been produced using the following aggregation methods: minimum elevation, maximum elevation, mean elevation, median elevation, standard deviation of elevation, systematic subsample, and breakline emphasis. The systematic subsample product is defined using a nearest neighbor resampling function, whereby an actual elevation value is extracted from the input source at the center of a processing window. Most vertical heights in GMTED2010 are referenced to the Earth Gravitational Model 1996 (EGM 96) geoid (NGA, 2010). In addition to the elevation products, detailed spatially referenced metadata containing attribute fields such as coordinates, projection information, and raw source elevation statistics have been generated on a tile-by-tile basis for all the input datasets that constitute the global elevation model. GMTED2010 is based on data derived from 11 raster-based elevation sources.",

The goal of the project is the development of a globally consistent hydrologic derivative data set. The effort has been led by U.S.G.S. scientists in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Programme/Global Resource Information Database (UNEP/GRID) located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the HYDRO1k database was made possible by the completion of the 30 arc-second digital elevation model at EROS in 1996, entitled GTOPO30. This data set, with its nominal cell size of 1 km, has been and will continue to be applied by many scientists and researchers to hydrologic and land form studies. Inevitably, these studies require development, at a minimum, of a standard suite of derivative products.\r\nThe HYDRO1k package provides, for each continent, a suite of six raster and two vector data sets. These data sets cover many of the common derivative products used in hydrologic analysis. The raster data sets are the hydrologically correct DEM, derived flow directions, flow accumulations, slope, aspect, and a compound topographic (wetness) index. The derived streamlines and basins are distributed as vector data sets.\r\n",

Vegetation phenology metrics at 500 meter spatial resolution are identified for up to two detected growing cycles per year. For pixels with more than two valid vegetation cycles, the data represent the two cycles with the largest NBAR-EVI2 amplitudes.\r\n\r\nProvided in each MCD12Q2 Version 6 Hierarchical Data Format 4 (HDF4) file are layers for the total number of vegetation cycles detected for the product year, the onset of greenness, greenup midpoint, maturity, peak greenness, senescence, greendown midpoint, dormancy, EVI2 minimum, EVI2 amplitude, integrated EVI2 over a vegetation cycle, as well as overall and phenology metric-specific quality information. A low-resolution browse image showing greenup is also available when viewing each MCD12Q2 granule. SDS layers may be multi-dimensional with up to two valid vegetation cycles.\r\n\r\nFor areas where the NBAR-EVI2 values are missing due to cloud cover or other reasons, the data gaps are filled with good quality NBAR-EVI2 values from the year directly preceding or following the product year.\r\n",

The underlying physical idea behind MAIAC is simple: because surface changes slowly in time compared to aerosols and clouds given the daily rate of global MODIS observations, the focus is on extensive characterization of the surface background in order to improve all stages of MAIAC processing. MAIAC starts with gridding MODIS measurements (L1B data) to a fixed grid at 1km resolution in order to observe the same grid cell over time and work with polar-orbiting observations as if they were geostationary.",

The three components are each stored in separate layers so they can be used independently to look at a particular type of ground cover or collectively to look at the entire surface. VCF products provide a continuous, quantitative portrayal of land surface cover at 250 meter pixel resolution, and hence, are widely used in environmental modeling and monitoring applications.",

A series of masks are applied to address known issues caused by terrain shadow, burn scars, cloudiness, or ice cover in oceans. A primary improvement in Version 6 is the generation of time series data, rather than a simple static representation of water, given that water bodies fluctuate in size and location over time due to both natural and anthropogenic causes. Provided in each MOD44W Version 6 Hierarchical Data Format 4 (HDF4) file are layers for land, water, no data, and an associated per pixel quality assurance (QA) layer that provides users with information on the determination of water.",

The algorithm for this product chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16 day period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle and the highest NDVI/EVI value. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. Information on each individual MODIS Vegetation Indices Product along with improvements/changes for Version 6 are available at: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis_products_table.",

The VCF5KYR data product is derived from a bagged linear model algorithm using Long Term Data Record Version 4 (LTDR V4) data compiled from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations. Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is the ratio of the area of the vertical projection of green vegetation above ground to the total area, capturing the horizontal distribution and density of vegetation on the Earth's surface. FVC is a primary means for measuring global forest cover change and is a key parameter for a variety of environmental and climate-related applications, including carbon land surface models and biomass measurements. The three bands included in each VCF5KYR Version 1 GeoTIFF are: percent of tree cover, non-tree vegetation, and bare ground. Additional information concerning these datasets can be found at: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/measures/measures_products_table.",

The VNP13 data products are designed after the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua Vegetation Indices product suite to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission. These products are designed to enhance the vegetation reflected signal from measured spectral responses by making use of the distinctive soil-vegetation characteristic in the red-edge area of the spectrum. Vegetation indices combine two or more spectral bands in the red (0.6 - 0.7 micrometer), NIR wavelengths (0.7-1.1 micrometer), and Blue (0.44-0.5 micrometer) regions. The VNP13 algorithm process produces three vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index-2 (EVI2). These products inform us about the status of vegetation health during the growing season and as it changes in response to environmental, climate, and anthropogenic drivers.\r\n\r\nValidation at stage 1 has been achieved for the VIIRS Vegetation Index (VI) product suite.\r\n",

The VIIRS sensor is located onboard the NOAA/NASA joint Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite. LAI is an index that quantifies the one-sided leaf area of a canopy, while FPAR is the fraction of incoming solar energy absorbed through photosynthesis at 400 to 700 nanometers. This product is intentionally designed after the Terra and Aqua MODIS LAI/FPAR operational algorithm to promote the continuity of the Earth Observation System (EOS) mission.\r\n\r\nThe VNP15A2H product includes six Science Data Set Layers for the analysis of key factors in LAI/FPAR measurements. These include the LAI and FPAR measurements, quality detail for LAI/FPAR, extra quality detail for FPAR, and the standard deviation for LAI and FPAR. Two low resolution browse images are also available for each VNP15A2H granule: (1) LAI and (2) FPAR.\r\n\r\nValidation at stage 1 has been achieved for the VIIRS LAI/FPAR products.\r\n",
